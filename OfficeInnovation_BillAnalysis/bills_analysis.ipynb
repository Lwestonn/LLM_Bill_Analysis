It establishes the Office of Broadband and Digital Literacy within the Department of Technology to oversee the development of a statewide open-access middle-mile broadband network.  The bill also revises the California Advanced Services Fund (CASF) program, expanding its goals and funding mechanisms to achieve near-universal broadband access by 2026.  Furthermore, it authorizes counties to build broadband infrastructure and includes provisions for CEQA exemptions for certain projects.

The bill mandates developers conduct performance evaluations and provide deployers with specific information, including evaluation results.  Deployers must disclose information to affected individuals, offer opt-out options and appeals, and undergo third-party audits.  Non-compliance allows for civil action by specified public entities, and relevant records are exempt from the California Public Records Act to protect trade secrets.  The bill also amends the Unruh Civil Rights Act to include considerations of ADS compliance in discrimination cases.\\n\",\n          \"AB 904 mandates that California health care service plans and insurers create maternal and infant health equity programs by January 1, 2025, addressing racial disparities through doula services.  Medi-Cal managed care plans fulfill this requirement by covering doula services if they are already a Medi-Cal benefit.  The Department of Managed Health Care, in consultation with the Department of Insurance, must report on these programs and doula coverage to the legislature by January 1, 2027.  The bill aims to improve maternal and infant health outcomes, particularly for Black and Native American communities, by expanding access to doula support.
