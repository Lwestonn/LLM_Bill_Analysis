AB-1049,"Celeste Rodriguez, Lee","AB-1049 amends California's Food Assistance Program (CFAP) by removing the application of federal deeming rules for sponsors' income and resources.  Currently, these rules, which consider a sponsor's income when determining a recipient's eligibility, apply to CFAP.  The bill instead establishes a three-year deeming period from the affidavit of support's execution, with exceptions for abuse victims.  This change may impose new costs on counties, requiring state reimbursement if mandated.  The bill also clarifies the evidence needed to establish abuse as grounds for exemption from deeming.

AB 904,Calderon,"AB 904 mandates that California health care service plans and insurers create maternal and infant health equity programs by January 1, 2025, addressing racial disparities through doula services.

The bill aims to improve maternal and infant health outcomes, particularly for Black and Native American communities, by expanding access to doula support.  No state reimbursement is required.
